## Automate Deployment using Octopus Deploy &Â VSTS

[Octopus Deploy](https://Octopus.com) is an automated deployment server that makes it easy to automate the deployment of ASP.NET web applications, Java applications, database updates, PHP application, and custom scripts into development, test, and production environments.

This lab shows how you can integrate VSTS and Octopus to deploy PHP application to Azure.


## Pre-requisites

1. **Microsoft Azure Account:** You will need a valid and active azure account for the lab.
 


2. You will need a **Visual Studio Team Services Account** and <a href="http://bit.ly/2gBL4r4">Personal Access Token</a>



## Setting up the project

1. Use <a href="https://vstsdemobuildertest.azurewebsites.net/" target="_blank">VSTS Demo Data Generator</a> to provision a project on your VSTS account.

2. Once the project is provisioned, select the URL to navigate to the project that you provisioned.

## Setting up the Environment

1. Click on **Deploy to Azure** to provision Octopus Server.

   <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FMicrosoft%2FVSTS-DevOps-Labs%2Foctopus%2Foctopus%2Farm%2520template%2Ftemplate.json"><img src="http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png"></a> 

2. Provide **Resource group** and **Octopus DNS Name**, check the **terms and conditions** and click **Purchase**

3. It takes approxinately 15 minutes to deploy. Once the deployment is succeeded, following resources will be provisioned in Azure:

    - Windows server 2012 VM with **Octopus** 
    - **App Service** to deploy PHP application

    <br/>

    <img src="images/Resources.png">

4. Click on the octopus-vm and note down the **DNS name**. We will need this to access Octopus server.

## Exercise 1: Configure Octopus server

In this exercise, we will create **deployment environment** in Octopus server. Since we are deploying the application to Azure App Service, we will link the environment to Azure using **Management Certificate**.

1. Login to Octopus server using DNS name from your browser. Use the below credentials to login.

   - **Username**: admin
   - **Password**: P2ssw0rd@123

   <br/>

   <img src="images/O1.png">

2. Click **Create environment** and **Add Environment**. In Octopus, an environment is a group of machines or cloud services, that you will deploy to at the same time; common examples of environments are Dev, Test, Staging or Production.

   <img src="images/Create Environment.png">

   <br/>

   <img src="images/Add Environment.png">

3. Provide the environment name and click **Save**.

   <img src="images/DevEnvironment.png">

4. You will see the created environment name on your screen . Now, link Azure account to this environment by clicking on **Accounts**

   <img src="images/Dev.png">


5. Click on **ADD ACCOUNT** beside **Azure Subscriptions**

   
   <img src="images/Add Account.png">

6. Enter the following details as shown and click **Save**

   - **Name**: Provide the account name.
   - **Subecription ID**: Your [Azure Subscription ID](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/mschray/2016/03/18/getting-your-azure-subscription-guid-new-portal/).
   - **Authentication Method**: Choose **Use Management Certificate**.
   >You can also use Service Principal authentication method by following [this link](https://octopus.com/docs/infrastructure/azure/creating-an-azure-account/creating-an-azure-service-principal-account)
   <br/>

   <img src="images/Create Account.png">


7. You will see a management certificate generated. Download this certificate.

   <img src="images/Download Certificate.png">

8. To upload the certificate on Azure, go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), and click on **Subscriptions**.

   <img src="images/O8.png">

9. Click on your Subscription.

   <img src="images/O9.png">

10. Scroll down and click **Management certificates**.

    <img src="images/O10.png">

11. Click **Upload** to upload the certificate which you downloaded in the step 7.

## Exercise 2: Link VSTS and Octopus Server

In this exercise we will create an **API** key in Octopus. This key is required to link VSTS with Octopus.

1. Under user profile, go to **MY API Key** and click **New API Key** to create one.

   <img src="images/API Key.png">

2. Give the **purpose** and click **Generate New**.

   <img src="images/Generate new.png">

3. Note down this API Key.

   <img src="images/Key.png">

4. Go to **VSTS project** which was provisioned earlier, click on <img src="images/gear.png"> **icon --> Services --> + New Service Endpint**, scroll down and select **Octopus Deploy**

   <img src="images/Endpoint.png">


6. Provide **Connection name**, **Octopus server URL** and **API Key** and click OK. 

   <img src="images/endpointName.png">

7. You will see service endpoint created successfully.

   <img src="images/EndpointSuccess.png">

## Exercise 3: Push the Package to Octopus Server

In this exercise, we will package PHP application and push the package to Octopus Server.

1. Go to **Builds** under **Build and Release** tab and click on **Octopus** build definition.

   <img src="images/Build Defination.png"> 
 
2. **Edit** the build defination to update Octopus server endpoint.

   <img src="images/EditBD.png">

3. In **Push Packages to Octopus** task, update **Octopus Deploy Server** and click **Save and queue**.

   <img src="images/QBuild.png">

  <table width="100%">
     <thead>
      <tr>
         <th width="50%"><b>Tasks</b></th>
         <th><b>Usage</b></th>
      </tr>
     </thead>
     <tr>
        <td><b>Package Application</b></td>
        <td>Packages the PHP code files into a zip file with version number</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td><b>Copy Files</b></td>
      <td>Copies the package from source directory to artifacts directory in build server</td>
     </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Push packages to Octopus</b></td>
        <td>Pushes the packages to Octopus server</td>
 


  </table>
<br/>


4. Once the build completes, you will see the build summary.

   <img src="images/Build Complete.png">

5. Go to Octopus Server. You will see the green check mark which indicates **Application package** is pushed successfully. Click **Upload package** to see the package.

## Exercise 4: Project Creation in Octopus

[Projects](https://octopus.com/docs/deploying-applications/deployment-process/projects) allow you to define all the details required to deploy a project including the steps to run and variables to configure it.
In this exercise, we will create project in Octopus which will deploy the package to **Azure Web Service**

1. Go to Octopus dashboard and click **Create a project** and **ADD PROJECT**.

   <img src="images/Project.png">

   <br/>

   <img src="images/Add Project.png">

2. Give the project name and click on **SAVE**.

   <img src="images/PUProject.png">

3. Once the project is created, click **Define your deployment process**. The [deployment process](https://octopus.com/docs/deploying-applications/deployment-process) is like a recipe for deploying your software.

## Exercise 5: Trigger Release in Octopus
In this exercise we will trigger the release manually from octopus project. Deployment will happen to Azure App Service.

1. Click on **Create Release** and **Save** it.

   <img src="images/Create New Release.png"> 

   <br/>

   <img src="images/SaveRelease.png"> 

8. Trigger the deployment to Azure App service by clicking on **DEPLOY TO DEV**, then click **Deploy** and wait untill the deployment steps are passed.
